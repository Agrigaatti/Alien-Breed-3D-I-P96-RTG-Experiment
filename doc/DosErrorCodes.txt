AmigaOS Manual: AmigaDOS Error Messages

This appendix lists AmigaDOS errors with their probable causes and suggestions for recovery. 
These error messages are the output from the system when your program fails or if a command is 
not executed as the result of a user error. Error messages differ from requesters, 
which are messages from the system that allow you to enter specific corrections, 
changes, or input so that the program, script, or command can continue execution. 
A requester that is not satisfied produces an error.

Error 	Messages 	                            Probable Cause 	Recovery Suggestion
103 	Not enough memory available 	        Not enough Memory in your Amiga to execute the operation. Memory may be fragmented. 	Close unnecessary windows and applications and re-issue the command. Reboot if this does not work. You may need to add more RAM to your system.
105 	Task Table Full 	                    The Amiga is limited to 20 CLI tasks. 	Try closing a few and then enter the command again.
115 	Bad number 	                            The command requires a numerical argument. 	Use the correct command format.
116 	Required argument missing 	            The command requires an argument that you did not supply. 	Use the correct command format.
117 	Value after keyword missing 	        Keyword was specified with no argument. 	Use the correct command format.
118 	Wrong number of arguments 	            Too few or too many arguments. 	Use the correct command format.
119 	Unmatched quotes 	                    You have an odd number of quotation marks. 	Place double quotation marks at the beginning and end of the path or string.
120 	Argument line invalid or too long 	    Your command line is incorrect or contains too many arguments. 	Use the correct command format.
121 	File is not executable 	                You misspelled the command name or the file is not a loadable (program or script) file. 	Retype the file name, ensuring that the file is a program file. To execute a script, the s bit must be set or the EXECUTE command must be used.
122 	Invalid resident library during load 	The required library was found but was not the correct type. This could be caused by having an old version of the library or the file is corrupt. 	Try searching for a newer version on the Internet or copying the file from your Workbench disks.
202 	Object is in use 	                    The specified file or directory is being edited by another application or is assigned. 	Stop the application using the file or directory or remove the assignment.
203 	Object already exists 	                The name specified is assigned to another file or directory. 	Use another name or delete the existing file or directory first.
204 	Directory not found 	                AmigaDOS cannot find the specified directory. 	Check the directory name and location (use DIR if necessary).
205 	Object not found 	                    AmigaDOS cannot find the specified file or device. 	Check the file name (use DIR) or the device name (use INFO).
206 	Invalid window description 	            Occurs when specifying a window size for a Shell, ED, or ICONX window. The window may be too big or too small or you omitted an argument. Also occurs with the NEWSHELL command, if a device name is supplied that is not a window. 	Use the correct window specification.
209 	Packet request type unknown 	        The device handler cannot do the requested operation. For example, the console handler cannot rename things. 	Check the request code passed to device handlers for the appropriate request.
210 	Object name invalid 	                There is an invalid character in the file name or the file name is too long. 	Retype the name; do not use any invalid characters or exceed the maximum length.
211 	Invalid object lock 	                The lock code was not recognized by the AmigaDOS call. 	This is a programming fault.
212 	Object is not of required type 	        You may have specified a file name for an operation that requires a directory name, or vice versa. 	Use the correct name and command format.
213 	Disk not validated 	                    If you have just inserted a disk, the disk validation process may be in progress. It is also possible that the disk is corrupt. 	Wait for the validation process to finish. Watch for drive light to turn off. Allow a minute for floppy disks and several minutes for hard disks. Corrupt disks cannot be validated. If corrupted, try retrieving and copying the files to another disk.
214 	Disk is write-protected 	            The plastic tab is in the write-protect position or the disk has been lokked. 	Remove the disk, move the tab, and reinsert the disk, use a different disk, or use LOCK OFF command.
215 	Rename across devices attempted 	    RENAME can move a file from one directory to another, but not from one volume to another. 	Use COPY to copy the file to the destination volume. Delete it from the source volume, if desired. Then use RENAME, if desired.
216 	Directory not empty 	                You tried to delete a directory that contains file or subdirectories. 	Use the ALL option of DELETE if you wish to delete the directory and its contents.
217 	Too many levels 	                    Directory nesting is too deep. 	Reorganize directories so that there are fewer levels or change directories in stages to reach the desired level.
218 	Device (or volume) is not mounted 	    If the devices is a floppy disk, it has not been inserted in a drive. If it is another type of device, it has not been mounted, or the name is misspelled. 	Insert the correct floppy disk, mount the device, check the spelling of the device name, revise your MountList/mount file, or assign the device name appropriately.
219 	Seek error 	                            An error occurred while processing a file. 	Be sure that you only SEEK within the file. You cannot SEEK outside the bounds of the file.
220 	Comment is too long 	                You filenote has exceeded the maximum number of characters (79). 	Use a shorter filenote.
221 	Disk is full 	                        There is not enough room on the disk to perform the requested operation. 	Delete unnecessary files or directories or use a different disk.
222 	Object is protected from deletion 	    The d (deletable) protection bit of the file or directory is clear. 	If you are certain that you want to delete the file or directory, use PROTECT to set the d bit or use the FORCE option of DELETE.
223 	File is write protected 	            The w (writable) protection bit of the file is clear. 	If you are certain that you want to overwrite the file, use PROTECT to set the w bit.
224 	File is read protected 	                The r (readable) protection bit of the file is clear. 	Use PROTECT to set the r bit of the file.
225 	Not a valid DOS disk 	                The disk in the drive is not an AmigaDOS disk, it has not been formatted, or it is corrupt. 	Be sure you are using the correct disk. If the disk worked previously, use a disk recovery program to salvage its files. Format unformatted disks.
226 	No disk in drive 	                    The disk is not inserted in the specified drive. 	Insert the appropriate disk in the specified drive.
232 	No more entries in directory 	        The AmigaDOS call EXNEXT has no further entries in the directory you are examining. 	Stop calling EXNEXT.
233 	Object is soft link 	                Attempt was made to access a soft-link for a device that does not support it. 	No recovery.
235 	Bad load file hunk 	                    The program loaded is corrupted. 	Load a new or original copy of the program.
241 	Record lock collision 	                Another application is accessing the database. 	Try accessing the database again.
242 	Record lock timeout 	                Another application has the database entry lokked. 	Try again or quit the other application and retry.
303 	Buffer overflow 	                    Occurs if pattern matching string is too long. 	Make pattern matching string shorter.
304 	***Break 	                            Occurs if program stopped via Ctrl + C. 	No recovery
305 	File not executable 	                The e (executable) bit of the file is clear. 	Same as Error 121.
